# Introduction

This repository contains the code for the paper 
[Sentence Bottleneck Autoencoders from Transformer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00055)
by Ivan Montero, Nikolaos Pappas, and Noah A. Smith published at EMNLP 2021.

This paper proposes an approach to learning sentence representations by applying an autoencoder on top of pretrained masked LMs.

Further documentation and code cleanup are under the works!
